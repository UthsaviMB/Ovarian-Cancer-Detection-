# Ovarian-Cancer-Detection-
This project leverages machine learning techniques for ovarian cancer detection, focusing on image preprocessing, classification, and TNM staging &amp; grading. The primary goal is to develop an accurate model that can classify cancer type, determine the stage, and provide TNM grading based on medical imaging data.
